# Typing Old Turkic 
## Keyboard layouts
To use Old Turkic script in your computer, you can download packages for your operation system below. Packages are slightly outdated, but still should work fine. If you are using Linux and not comfortable replacing system files, just copy the relevant section containing the keyboard layout from the file contents. You probably (should) know how to do that already, and don't forget to back up the files you are modifying in case something goes wrong.

For macOS, if you want to install the keyboard layout in user-level, put the contents in `/your_user_name/Library/Keyboard Layouts`. If you would like to install it for all users, you can put it in `/Library/Keyboard Layouts`. This will make it available for all users of the system.

For Windows, just install the keyboard layout by double clicking on setup.exe inside the package.

## Additional notes
As of this date, all major operating systems include built-in support for viewing Old Turkic script. Windows 8, and macOS 10.11 onward include necessary fonts to correctly display Old Turkic text. If your Linux distribution-of-choice does not include an Old Turkic font by default, Noto Fonts are probably available through your distribution's package manager, check there first.

If you are having issues with displaying Old Turkic text in your browser, make sure that you are using the latest version of Firefox or Safari. Do not use Chrome -- it's spyware! Edge is also not 100% clean, but it is a good-performing browser under Windows.
