Here you can find some software that I've written.
## mcc
mcc is a basic text-to-morse converter, written for command-line. With mcc, it is possible to convert Latin text to morse code, and copy the conversion result directly to clipboard for use in other applications. mcc offers output with or without whitespace between morse codes.

mcc is written in Swift. Source code and binaries from recent releases can be found on the link below.
